# CRF-LSTM-NER
a CRF-LSTM NER model in Tensorflow. <br>
a example on how to use it can be found in "[Example.ipynb](https://github.com/JZ-LIANG/CRF-LSTM-NER/blob/master/Example.ipynb)"



## Reference
This model is based on the following papers:
* Lample, Guillaume, et al. "[Neural architectures for named entity recognition.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360)" arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.01360 (2016).
